			<p id="text">Farming is something a regular Genshin Impact player does for a little bit everyday. Travelers are given this replenishable resource known as "resin" that travelers are required to consume in order to claim the rewards from their farming. There's a cap of 160 of it, and you need about 20-60 of it to claim the rewards depending on what you were farming for. There are several different things that players farm for. Some examples are Mora, which is the currency used in the game and is also consumed when leveling up other things; Experience books, which are used to increase the level of your characters; Bosses, which drop items that are used to ascend your characters past level thresholds; Talent books, which are used to increase the strength of your characters' individual skills; Weapon Ascension Materials, which allow you to ascend your weapons past their level threshold; and lastly artifacts, which provide significant buffs and stat increases to your characters. The previously mentioned "resin system" was designed as a "pace limiter." It is designed with the intention of limiting the pace at which players can make their characters stronger, so that players keep coming back to the game everyday.
