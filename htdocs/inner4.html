			<p id="text">Spiral Abyss is where most people go when they still want to keep playing the game yet their content is already exhausetd. There is also an incentive to complete the Abyss as there are primogem rewards for completing floors with stars. The Abyss also resets every 2 weeks, so it is a steady source of primogems. Many people have their own reasons for trying their hands at Spiral Abyss, whether it be they want to prove they're strong, just general bragging rights, boredom, the primogem rewards, it could be anything. However, in order to succeed within the Abyss, players must have very high investment when it comes to their characters. This means several weeks of farming in order to ascend 8 characters, as the Abyss needs two teams of four. The characters not only need to have high levels, but also high weapon levels, talent levels, and artifact levels. Not to mention that artifacts have completely random stats and substats, so one may farm for weeks or months and still not the stats they need in order to have the most damage output for the Abyss.
